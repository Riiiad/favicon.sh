# favicon.sh
A script that generates favicons of *all* variants.

#### Usage
```bash
./favicon.sh myImage.png
```

If favicon.sh is executed without an argument the script looks for `favicon.png`.
If `favicon.png` doesn't exist the script exits.

It is recommended that the original image be greater than or equal to `558x558`
